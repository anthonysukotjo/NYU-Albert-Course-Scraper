It focuses on collective violence rather than on individual acts of violence, regardless of how many victims an individual may have claimed. One part of the course considers the extent to which American culture and political institutions encourage, sanctify, or militate against aggressive behavior and create a climate for or against violence. In that context, some of our concerns must be comparative, cross-cultural, and transnational. In addition, we address broad interdisciplinary conceptual questions that anthropologists, psychologists, and sociologists, in particular, ask about human nature, gender conditioning in Western cultures, and ?deviant? subcultures. In creating a typology for the analysis of violence in American cities over time, we distinguish between forms of violence, the direction of changes sought, and the social and material characteristics of the antagonists?is the conflict generated, for example, by a privileged elite seeking to protect the authority that it feels is being jeopardized by aspiring newcomers, or is it rooted in efforts by the dispossessed struggling to gain some notion of a fair share?

   Reading Vergil'S Aeneid</b>

  <div style="display: block;" id="shortDescription_126857" class="courseDescription noDisplay">

    <p style="font-size: 12px">While not everyone agrees on what books constitute the Western ?canon,? Vergil?s Aeneid is surely one of those texts that, for better or worse, has influenced how we think and act. The book is the epic story of a hero, Aeneas, who escapes from his homeland in Asia, Troy, after it has been sacked by the Greeks. Aeneas wanders westward in search of a new home, arrives in Italy, and then wages a war with the native population to set in motion a divinely ordained process that culminates, centuries after his death, in the founding of Rome. Apart from being a gripping story, the Aeneid can also be r...

    <p style="font-size: 12px">While not everyone agrees on what books constitute the Western ?canon,? Vergil?s Aeneid is surely one of those texts that, for better or worse, has influenced how we think and act. The book is the epic story of a hero, Aeneas, who escapes from his homeland in Asia, Troy, after it has been sacked by the Greeks. Aeneas wanders westward in search of a new home, arrives in Italy, and then wages a war with the native population to set in motion a divinely ordained process that culminates, centuries after his death, in the founding of Rome. Apart from being a gripping story, the Aeneid can also be read as a foundation myth for the West. It explores the tension between public and private, and between duty and desire; it raises questions about the benefits?and costs?of empire; and it explores increasingly timely questions about the effects that war has on nations and on individuals. The poem also problematizes knowledge, raising very real questions about how (or even if) we know what we think we know. Involves close analysis of this single book, in English translation and collateral readings from other ancient texts as well as a discussion of recent scholarly literature. Students participate in special study trips to several major museums and develop their own special projects.

Among the themes to be addressed?in the films, the readings, the class discussion, and, eventually, the final papers?are the following: war and civil war as represented and remembered in the postwar decades; the Cold War; decolonization; the European ?economic miracle? and its attendant social impact; the ?sixties?; different generations of migration, both into Europe and within and between countries; national identities and the attached stereotypes; the Yugoslav Wars; remembering (and forgetting) Communism; the Holocaust in postwar European consciousness. A final paper requires students to choose one theme and then, with instructor?s assistance, identify a body of related films to see and discuss.

Time will be spent in England and America in the 19th century, when disbelief was being tied to radical politics, before moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. Authors whose works will be read may include Cicero, Hume, Holbach, Paine, Shelley, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Freud, among others.

    <p style="font-size: 12px">Oscar Wilde’s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a cultural lightning rod. When it was first published in England, a firestorm of criticism hit the newspapers and literary magazines, decrying the work as “morbid” and “unhealthy”—coded language that suggested homosexuality to the late-Victorian public. The novel has a complicated publication history. It survives in two versions: the first was published in the U. S., six months before it appeared in England. Wilde’s novel provides a perfect case study in how to approach a literary text in its historical context. This three-week course will focus on the novel’s various manuscript and print versions, Wilde’s correspondence about the work, and critical responses to the text. Various themes of the work will be addressed, such as Wilde’s London, yellow journalism, British jurisprudence, the Labouchere Amendment, the language of flowers, opium dens, Aesthetic Movement philosophy, East End theater, 1890s fashion, “inversion,” late-Victorian portraiture, bibliophilia, book design, Victorian ghost stories, and French decadence. Students will be required to do in-depth research with the Fales Library’s holdings exploring these topics and their relevance to our understanding of the novel. The goal will be to allow students to do primary research and to see how vital original sources are for the study of literary texts.

We will examine how the term "religion" is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the phenomenon of "political religions" (nationalism, racism, totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or distort modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill the vacuum that Sartre called "the God-shaped hole in the soul of modern man" that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality will need to occur.

Yet, in the same era, there was a march forward—toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence for all of Europe… and for our own culture. Through the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible of all the centuries before the 21st. Please note that this course does not satisfy the advanced research seminar requirement for the history major.

Often, the power of an iconic image extends beyond the meaning of its original purpose and takes on another form socially and historically. This seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers, artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in addressing the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and film. It combines historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to identity politics and visual culture, and addresses how images are constructed through art, media, advertising, political campaigns, war and disaster, beauty, and popular culture. Class discussions highlight the trends and transformations that have characterized the evolution of the iconic image. Using a series of case studies, we explore the construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race, and pop culture. We also consider issues of representation, display, and reception, as well as the wider social context in which art, music, and culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In addition to classes held on campus, field trips are taken to archives, museums and galleries. Each week students discuss a photograph of their own choice. Cross-listed with Photography and Imaging of the Tisch School of the Arts as PHTI-UT 1120, section 004.

Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as ?the chaptered novel,? it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions.

    <p style="font-size: 12px">The Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as ?the chaptered novel,? it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan in southern China at its dramatic center the novel intimately explores the questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love and affection, or ?qing,? as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the excesses and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure, intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English.

We start with the fact that systems that evolve – whether biological, cognitive, or cultural – are produced from an iterative sequence of propagation, variation, and selection. Therefore, the things that result are patterns shaped by interaction and must “work.” In considering the general principles for the creation of patterns, including those of physics and chemistry, you will learn and apply metapatterns as general tools for analyzing systems. Metapatterns include binaries, borders, layers, alphabet-like systems, arrows in time, and breaks and cycles in time. Your exploration and findings about these and other wide-ranging, logical principles (such as systems theory, networks, positive and negative feedbacks) can include topics that interest you, such as the nature of physical laws, patterns of life from physical trees to evolutionary trees, animal societies, language, music, symbols, architecture, mental phenomena (i.e., the time-patterns of thoughts), politics, philosophy, and a wide spectrum of environmental issues. For a sense of the material, see the instructor’s book Metapatterns Across Space, Time, and Mind, or the instructor’s papers about metapatterns available from this website (http://metapatterns.wikidot.com/members:tylervolk; for example, Volk and Bloom (2007)), or the instructor’s trio of YouTube videos on metapatterns (search “professortylevolk” and “metapatterns”).

After attempting to develop coherent accounts of this phenomenon, students in this seminar consider ways in which pacifist systems of thought have interacted with violent systems of justification, often but not always with genocidal results. It was in the midst of such a violent crisis that Hobbes initiated what remains an undeveloped approach. If one can extrapolate from Hobbes?s nationalist agenda and redirect his approach in a democratic way, one can arrive (as many have) at the following claim: only when globally sovereign conflict-resolving institutions are fully authorized will any subordinate system justifying violence lose its force and coherence, except in the case of violent revolutionary movements which challenge the global authority itself. Partly by examining various fledgling attempts to operate aspects of a future sovereign system, we ask of this claim not so much whether it is practical as whether we resist its implications or suspect its grounding.

The notion of the absurd is most closely associated with the Theater of the Absurd, launched in the 1950s in Paris by, notably, Beckett and Ionesco, and continued worldwide by such playwrights as Pinter, Albee, Havel, and Frisch. But the preoccupation with the absurd was not limited to the theater; in the immediate post?World War II period, the Existentialists already had posited the absurdity of the human condition, and works by Sartre and Camus brilliantly explored this philosophic position. The metaphysical anguish at the base of absurdist attitudes stemmed from what Martin Esslin, the author of the seminal Theater of the Absurd, called the disappearance of ?the certitudes and unshakable basic assumptions of former ages.? Kafka?s work is exemplary; many other writers view the world as fundamentally absurd, including Pirandello, Stein, Gombrowicz, Grass, Heller, Cortzar, Vonnegut, Pynchon, Kertsz. Many filmmakers shared these perspectives, including Antonioni and Godard. In a century that witnessed two unbelievably destructive worldwide conflicts, that made possible the Holocaust and other genocides, that produced Hiroshima and the capacity for humankind to destroy itself and the entire world, it is no surprise that the absurd was a dominant stance, even if often treated with devastating humor.

But we also explore a realm stranger still: the middle. For while middles have a reputation as expendable transitions between points of importance, they are also places of great mystery, where material too strange, too delicate, or too sexy to touch the rest of the world finds a home. Although music will be at the ?core? of the course, we will also look comparatively at strategies in Shakespeare and experimental theater, in films such as those by David Lynch and the Coen Brothers, at examples from modern dance, and at storytelling ranging from the Bible and Moby Dick to manga. This course is designed to give students tools with which to ask new questions about what kind of stuff goes where and why that might be. There are no prerequisites for this course. It will count toward the Music major or minor.

    <p style="font-size: 12px">Edmund Wilson (1895–1972) was the greatest cultural critic that America has ever produced—or so a good many cultural critics of our own time have come to believe. Wilson belonged to a circle of writers from the First World War generation that included John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Edna St. Vincent Millay.

Wilson belonged to a circle of writers from the First World War generation that included John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Edna St. Vincent Millay. He wrote novels, poetry, plays, and diaries. But mostly he wrote book reviews and essays on literary, political and historical topics, which ran in the New Republic, the New Yorker, the New York Review of Books and other magazines. Reading a substantial sampling of Wilson’s work, we will examine a series of large topics, including the cultural atmosphere of Greenwich Village early in the 20th century; the rise of literary modernism; the influence of Marxism; the literature of the Civil War; and various traditions of American thought and literature over the centuries. We will pay close attention to Wilson’s style of journalistic writing: his emphases on clarity, on conversational ease, and on emotional forcefulness. Students will be asked to apply Wilson’s principles of writing to their own compositions—an extremely useful thing to do for any student who seeks to become a better writer. Cross-listed with Journalism as JOUR-UA 401, section 001.

What are the relations between the concept of “power” and such related concepts as “authority,” “influence,” “manipulation,” “coercion,” “force,” and “violence”?

We will look at some classical writings (from Thomas Hobbes to Max Weber), at modern writers (such as Hannah Arendt, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel Foucault), and at work by contemporary political scientists and sociologists. Abstract discussion will be leavened throughout by case studies exemplifying the conceptual discussion.

    <p style="font-size: 12px">Conflicts over racial equality, freedom of speech, and equal protection under the law that were guaranteed in the Constitution have been contested terrain throughout U.S. history. These struggles sharpened in the 20th century as African Americans fought to end racial segregation, women sought equal rights, business interests resisted labor militancy, while federal and state governments suppressed radicals and other dissenters. This seminar examines the legal struggles and the social movements that took place as Americans fought for civil rights and civil liberties during periods of war, industrial unrest, and social change. It will explore these stories by analyzing legal history through the lenses of political, social, and cultural history. This is an interdisciplinary course. Students study novels, poems, oral memoirs, view films, and read historical monographs that speak to this big and important subject. The Tamiment Library, one of the most important repositories in the United States documenting the history of radical politics, civil rights, and civil liberties, will be our laboratory. Students will work with archives and other special collections on a weekly basis. They will learn how to use and evaluate these primary sources, interpret evidence, make analytical arguments, and develop research questions. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 664. Please note that this course does not satisfy the advanced research seminar requirement for the history major.

People who love someone, something or some activity, sometimes find that they have been drawn into a room with a little door on a far wall—remaining firmly shut if they are lucky or careful—that leads to a dark and often violent inversion of what drew them in the first place. 

The ancient Greeks called the dark matter of love stasis, and they knew all too well the contours of the violence that could erupt where it ruled. Shakespeare, under their influence, illuminated for us many of the rooms in the house of love. But it fell to his contemporary, Thomas Hobbes, to recommend building on new principles altogether, requiring of political subjects only the lowest form of self-love—a kind of safe retreat from the most basic forms of rivalry. To some recent theorists, Hobbes’ now-dominant mode of imagining our common space rests on a basic indifference to—and certainly not love of—the higher forms of life. They blame it for the more horrific, systemic forms of violence over which the modern state has presided. Far from showing us the way out of civic violence, the liberal social contract, they argue, has instead taught us how to hate with indifference. We may agree that this is true, while still wishing for a more comprehensive explanation not rooted in mere political theory—or we may disagree altogether. 

Readings drawing from Thucydides, Sophocles, Plutarch, Machiavelli, Shakespeare, Hobbes, Marx, Max Scheler, Freud, Schmitt, Bataille, Foucault, Girard, Agamben, Zizek. Background reading in the ancient philosophy and theology of love, exploring love of truth, friends, money, honor, country, family and virtue, along with erotic love; comparison of eastern and western ascetic ideals as modes of redirecting love; violence in animal communities; hate speech.

    <p style="font-size: 12px">The seventy-or-so years this seminar examines were among the most turbulent in the history of the world. They start with the butchery of World War II, the Shoah, and atomic devastation, and end with the often violent birth of new nations through the decolonization of African and Asian lands. But they were also years of reconstruction and modernization, leading to booming economies and social improvement. The rise of Arab nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism and the emergence of China as the colossus of the 21st century were among the signposts of a changing world in which peoples demanded—and won—their freedom. Perhaps most revolutionary, women at last attained freedom and equality in many parts of the globe. Many writers and thinkers felt such concern for the world around them that they were inevitably drawn to dealing with contemporary issues. Others focused on broader, more philosophic approaches to the existential problems of man in this world; others still sought escape from commitment in artistic paths, removed from social and political considerations. By working with texts— novels, essays, short stories, plays, and films—that reflect artists’ and intellectuals’ reactions to their times, we will explore and analyze many of the leading creative voices of these turbulent years, including, but not limited to: Arthur Miller, Albert Camus, Assia Djebar, Samuel Beckett, Eugène Ionesco, Betty Friedan, and James Baldwin.

While some elements of this reputation are well-earned, the history of the Inquisition is far more complex and interesting. We begin the semester with the heated question of the origins of the Inquisition and its key role in nation building, in order to then turn to the Inquisition’s internal organization and standard practices. From there, we consider the various targets of inquisitorial suspicion or persecution from the late fifteenth through the late seventeenth centuries: Judaism and crypto-Judaism (the conversos), Protestantism, prohibited books, mystics and Illuminati, witches, Islam and crypto-Islam (the moriscos), and those accused of sexual or religious misconduct (blasphemy, bigamy, and sodomy). We close the semester considering what finally brought about the definitive abolition of the Inquisition in 1834. We will read transcripts from Inquisitorial trials, edicts and proclamations, historical chronicles, novels, plays, autobiographies, an Inquisitor’s manual with instructions for torture, a witch hunting treatise, and devotional literature. We also will examine more contemporary reflections: Dostoevsky’s 1880 The Brothers Karamazov, Monty Python’s 1970 “Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition” skit, and the film adaptation of J.K. Rowling’s 2003 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Cross-listed with Spanish as SPAN-UA 952.

This course explores the relationship between politics, power and famine, with particular reference to the influence of political cultures and institutions on decision making in the modern world, through a number of case studies over the past two centuries. It analyses the debates on the Amartya Sen thesis, that famines in the modern world are due less to the failure of food-supply as such, and more to the failure of non-democratic political systems. We will explore a series of case–studies of specific famines, including Ireland (1845-52), Finland (1868), Bengal (1943-44, 1974-75) Russia /USSR (1893, 1920-1, 1932-4), China (1964), and Ethiopia (1983-5). Cross-listed with Irish Studies as IRISH-UA 185, and with History as HIST-UA 799. Please note that this course does not satisfy the advanced research seminar requirement for the history major.

In literature and film, it’s a story about an organic member of an intimate social setting (say the family or the village) who becomes an enlightened, independent but lonely and alienated “individual” amidst the crowd of strangers in the modern city. Or, conversely, it is about this cosmopolitan intellectual or professional’s uneasy return to the hometown, to the countryside, about his or her confrontation with an embarrassing past, which can be disengaged rationally but not emotionally. This tension and mutual dependency between the country and the city offers us an excellent opportunity to examine and rethink the epic experience of modern China as exemplary of the human experience of modernity.

We will also read accounts of these themes in the works of the Muslim physicians, philosophers, and theologians (al-Fārābī, Ibn Sīnā and al-Ghazālī), and discuss the ways in which concepts of Love, Madness and Prophecy were received in the Medieval West and during the Renaissance and beyond.

How do diplomats and governments react to these changes? Does traditional diplomacy still matter in today’s world?  What skills are required to be a competent diplomat in the 21st century? This seminar aims to answer these questions by exploring the many dimensions of contemporary diplomacy. We will begin with an historical perspective and then explore the different types of diplomatic activities, such as political, commercial, cultural, and scientific; bilateral and multilateral; soft and hard; secret, discreet, and public. We will also focus on current challenges facing diplomacy. Topics will be addressed through selected readings, discussions with the instructor, guest speakers, and visits to diplomatic missions in New York.

How can we ever be happy?  Can philosophy help us get through difficult times?  These are questions raised in The Consolation of Philosophy, a dialogue written by the Roman philosopher Boethius (c.480-524/6), while staying in prison and waiting for King Theodoric’s order for his execution.  Boethius’s Consolation touched the hearts of many readers in the Middle Ages (and beyond) and influenced the work of numerous writers and philosophers from this period.  In the Divine Comedy, for example, Dante places Boethius in the Fifth Heaven.  His Consolation was translated by, among others, King Alfred (848/9–899), Chaucer (c.1340–1400), and Queen Elizabeth I (1533–1603).  In our course, we will consider many of questions raised by Boethius by reading The Consolation of Philosophy and (mostly) medieval adaptations of and responses to Boethius and Boethian themes, including Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde, the Death of King Arthur; and The Seafarer and other Old English elegies.  We will also consult philosophical works that influenced Boethius: e.g. Plato, Aristotle, and St. Augustine. This course will count as a pre-1800 course towards the English major.

Stone understood the necessity of a fight that brings rights to all peoples. There were those who felt she and some of the other women present were dupes of the abolitionists. History would unfortunately prove this correct, for when African-American men were given the vote through the 15th Amendment, the abolitionists felt their work was done. It would take another 50 years before women would be granted the right to vote. Recognizing, as Lucy Stone did, that the fight for human rights does not exist in a vacuum, this course will look at the intersection of the three major American movements for African-American rights, women’s rights, and gay rights. Looking back over 160 years of history, we will compare and contrast the three movements. We will also examine how events in the United States and around the world informed and changed the dialogue on civil rights as so many fight even today to keep the conversation alive. Please note that this course does not satisfy the advanced research seminar requirement for the history major.

Our temporal focus will be the Middle Ages; we conclude with the beginnings of the ‘Age of Discovery’ (16th century) and discuss how significant changes in technology, politics, and conquest challenged older patterns of mercantile mobility and cultural exchange. The purpose of this seminar will be to understand this complex and integrated commercial and cultural system, by considering the movements of goods and peoples across the Indian Ocean world. This course will count as either a history or topics course towards the MEIS major.

    <p style="font-size: 12px">This course will investigate the problems of difference, progress and development that confronted those who sought to improve the condition of Ireland through the application of new ideas that gained currency in the 18th century Enlightenment.  Although an integral part of the British Empire, Ireland was notoriously economically under-developed, culturally distinct, socially turbulent and religiously diverse.  Consequently Ireland was the subject of a vast literary and political debate about how the society should be transformed, how its culture should evolve, its language adapt, and its people change their ways.  At the end of the 18th century, the movement of the United Irishmen attempted to put in practice a vision of Enlightenment philosophy, first through cultural politics, then through revolutionary activity, finally through a failed military rebellion.  To put these events in context, we will attempt to chart the history of ideas about society as they were applied to Ireland through two distinct approaches.  We will read signal works of British and Irish Enlightenment philosophy and applied social analysis, by famous writers including Jonathan Swift, Adam Smith, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, and Maria Edgeworth, as well as works by lesser known writers who sought earnestly to solve what was known as the Irish Problem.  Alongside this reading, we will conduct an experimental Digital analysis of a large corpus of works written about Ireland in the period.  The course will be conducted as a research seminar with a weekly Digital Laboratory component in which students will work to contribute to the corpus of digitized books, as well as to the effort to analyze the corpus through custom-designed analytical tools.

    <p style="font-size: 12px">This course, CONDUCTED IN ENGLISH, offers an introduction to Brazilian literature and film by focusing on a topic that has attracted a number of excellent Brazilian writers and filmmakers in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Taking as a point of departure familiar clichés about poverty in developing nations, the course will show how this problem has been considered from inside the country in question. Although some of the secondary reading is drawn from other contexts and disciplines (anthropology and political science), the course focuses primarily on modes of imagining and documenting the experience of poverty in Brazilian literature and film, and about the uses and implications of these narratives. We will discuss texts by Graciliano Ramos, Carolina Maria de Jesus, Clarice Lispector, Rubem Fonseca, and Patricia Melo and view films (Barren Lives, The Scavengers, The Hour of the Star, Pixote, Bus 174 and City of God, Babilônia 2000 and Black Orpheus), among others, in light of these questions. For each text or film we will ask: what is at stake in representing poverty in just this way? How do these narratives circulate, where and to what end? Who profits and who doesn't? In what historical moment and cultural setting did they arise? How do they present the connections of poverty with violence, stigmatization, and citizenship rights? How do they frame the ethical responsibilities of the writer or filmmaker, as well as of readers and viewers? As these questions can be asked in a broader context, this course also aims to sharpen students' critical thinking about widely prevalent modes of representing poverty.

    <p style="font-size: 12px">The questions “What is memory?” and “What is forgetting?” have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today’s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as how is memory embodied? How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self—and with language and story-telling—and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center’s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that serves their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed.

The course will be built around student acquisition of a set of analytical techniques, including statistical sampling, demographic data analysis, and database construction, as well as student application of SPSS and ArcGIS software. Among the digital and statistical skills imparted in this class will be understanding demographic dataset structures and design, learning approaches to regularizing and “cleaning” rough data for effective analysis, user training in IPUMS-USA data resources, and use of ArcGIS to organize and manage geographically variant historic data within an urban setting using georeferencing. In addition, the course will impart firm historical knowledge of the time period with readings and discussion on the material culture, social characteristics, and living conditions of Irish populations in nineteenth century New York and Ireland.

Can we distinguish between what people say about these things and deeper or truer realities?  Do people sometimes act as though they have a concept that governs their union, even if they are not aware of it?  How strong are the analogies between voluntary associations, where the unifying concept may be clearly codified and affirmed, and political associations?  Is the knowledge system that informs these concepts and provides ancillary support a historic artifact?  Do conceptual unions based on indoctrination face special challenges? We will explore these and other questions using a wide mix of materials from Greek tragedy to political theory to divorce narratives.  One aim will be to draw on the diverse disciplinary perspectives that students bring to the table.  The final project may, accordingly, take various forms, from a work of fiction, to sustained philosophical or literary analysis, to historical research.

We will then discuss the latest neuroscience and cognitive psychology underlying the each of these unique creative arts. Small teams of students will then research and present questions and discussion topics related to the topic. Strong collaboration, participation, and interaction as well as little sweat are all requirements for class sessions.

We will also explore the decline of the major European empires on sporting and cultural identities at global level.

A significant goal of the course is to explore the relationship between non-normativity and invisibility on the U.S. stage. Through the study of drama, performance, and a variety of theoretical texts from different disciplines, “The Future of Normal” surveys the kinds of theatre (originating in western cultures) that focus on the material body that challenges “normative” ideologies, practices, conditions, and technologies of sexuality and gender as they relate to staged corporeality. We acknowledge the foundations of gender-bending in, for instance, the works of Euripides, Shakespeare, and Jonson and explore more recent solo works by Kate Bornstein (M to F), Ron Athey (live body piercing and branding) and Greg Wallace (born with cerebral palsy). Intentionally, ‘The Future of Normal” explores the complicated relationships that exist among bodies, identities, culture, science, and technology--both on- and offstage--with special attention paid to a glaringly invisible community from U.S. stage representation: the intersexed.

Though they were very different from each other, all had more subjective, idiosyncratic ways of understanding and representing reality. We start with icons of Realism (e.g., Balzac, James, Ibsen) and continue through twentieth-century masterpieces of anti-realism, from novels by Camus, Robbe-Grillet and Paul Auster, to plays by Pirandello, Brecht, Ionesco, Beckett and Pinter, concentrating on form, language, and conventions, and the relationship of the work to the reader or spectator. In addition to literature, we contrast “traditional” narrative cinema with nonlinear cinema, and Realism in painting with contemporary non-realistic art. Throughout, we examine critical texts related aesthetics of Realism and anti-realism.

Can individual experience portray collective historical reality? Should we understand an artist’s oeuvre in relation to his or her personal life? In what ways do individual works bestow human experience with specific epistemologies and with social and historical realities? Are Irving Goffman’s ideas about the performance of self in everyday life relevant to the personal identities represented in museums, in documentary film, in architecture, and on theatrical stages? Can the individual lives represented in art accurately represent abstract social relations? Texts for the course include works by Irving Goffman, Errol Morris, Erik Erikson, Joseph Roach, Freddie Rokem, Deirdre Heddon, and selected plays, films and museum displays.

The course will be built around the acquisition and deployment of digital analysis techniques for historical census data, focusing on the population of New York City. Skills emphasized will be collecting and organizing demographic data, statistical analysis of historical sources, and conveying research findings using today's digital mapping and chart-production programs. No prior knowledge in digital tools is required, although the aim will be for students to acquire digital analytical skills useful for a broad range of research.

We will work with primary sources such as slave testimonies, declarations of independence, and revolutionary discourses, and read literary texts by authors such as Julia Alvarez, Alejo Carpentier, Junot Diaz, Gabriel García Márquez, Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda, and José Martí. We will also study some of the most influential approaches to the Caribbean in cultural studies, anthropology and history. While the class will be taught in English, reading knowledge of Spanish and French is very welcome.

How have writers, intellectuals and citizens struggled to find a voice during wartime in the face of censorship, propaganda, trauma and the technologies of violence? What does it mean to live in a culture of war? Focusing in particular on questions of gender, imperialism and resistance, this course explores these questions in a range of British, American and postcolonial novels, poems, memoirs, military writings, theoretical texts, films and popular culture from the 20th and 21st century.

Beginning with some foundational representations of war cultures by Homer, Shakespeare and Tolstoy, we will chart the transformations and mutations of modern war culture from the eras of colonial warfare, total warfare during the First World War and the “People’s War” of  World War Two, to more recent conflicts like the apocalyptic imaginary of the Cold War; the Vietnam war; guerrilla warfare and counterinsurgency; and the mythology of “high tech warfare” in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Readings may be drawn from the work of: Homer, Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, Ernst Junger, Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf, George Orwell, W.H. Auden, Elizabeth Bowen, Tim O’Brien and Michael Ondaatje. We will also examine recent war fiction by writers like Anthony Swofford, Lea Carpenter, Kevin Powers, Brian Turner, Ben Fountain, Siobhan Fallon, Phil Klay, Matt Gallagher, Joydeep Roy-Bhattacharya, Sinan Antoon and Riverbend. Films may include: The Battle of the Somme, Listen to Britain, Dr. Strangelove, The Battle of Algiers, Apocalypse Now, Come and See, The Thin Red Line, Three Kings, Generation Kill, Restrepo, and American Sniper. The course will also include visits by several war writers, veterans and activists.

Student writing will be split between analytical essays on writers like Turgenev, Peter Handke, Maxine Hong Kingston, Faulkner, Kafka, Freud and Toibin and Friel and the production of original work using the forms and constraints these writers employed as objects of imitation. Such forms include the letter, the case history, the mystery, stream-of-consciousness and the invocation of biblical or classical material. In addition to exploring different genres as methods of creating a self, the course will examine the use of different subjects through which a “self” is imagined: mothers (Peter Handke, Maxine Hong Kingston, Colm Toibin), fathers (Kafka), siblings (Benjy’s section of The Sound and The Fury) and early love (Turgenev). We will also examine the process by which narratives constructed for the page are re-shaped as productions for the stage (comparison of Mark Haddon’s Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night to the current London production) and to the use of multiple sustained monologues in plays like Faith Healer. This is a course specially designed for students with an interest in producing autobiographical work, work in the first person that “poses” as autobiography, or work that draws on the deliberate constraints of a form (letter, case history, mystery) as a way to illuminate autobiographical material.

For two hundred years, against all odds, the Crusaders managed to keep some of their newly won lands. They lost more of them with every passing decade, however, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the Middle East was lost to Western Christendom. 
We live in a time when the memory and the rhetoric about the crusades, for good or ill, permeate the Western World and the Islamic World, especially in the Middle East. This seminar addresses the many aspects of the crusading fervor which inform beliefs and politics to this day, such the nature of a Christian holy war and the nature of jihad; the question of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the relations among the three great religious groups and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own.

It will serve as an introduction to archival research while addressing the scholarly issues raised by the students’ projects. Presentations are thus to be organized with students’ projects in mind, and designed to enable archival research in a range of topics, periods of specialization, and languages. In addition to on-site workshops utilizing NYU’s Fales Library and Special Collections, the course introduces students to the vast array of archival resources offered by New York City; an overnight trip to a distant archive (perhaps the Library of Congress or the Beinecke Library, both of which offer junior-level research fellowships that may be of interest) and information sessions on the construction and use of internet archives broaden the experience beyond city limits. In many humanities courses, students learn about a subject through reading secondary materials. Their research, however, is rarely significant in terms of discovering new knowledge or generating new perspectives. Working with primary materials in special collections, students in this class have an opportunity to work on materials and ideas that have not previously been considered. Participants will be guided as to how they might contribute original and truly ‘new’ discoveries to their fields of interest.

Since then, both at the heights of its influence in the 1980’s and 1990’s, and persistently contested after the 2000’s, the “neoliberal era” shaped the destiny of most Latin American nations. 
In this context, Latin America will become a laboratory of creative interventions that explore new formats and new audiences, as in the emergence of the cartoneras publishing houses, the interface between technology and collective mobilization, and the networks between art collectives and social movements. Analyzing literary and cinematographic works by figures such Lucrecia Martel, Eduardo Coutinho and Roberto Bolaño, installations by Teresa Margolles, together with diverse experiences of cultural collectives, this course will explore the ways in which culture produces not only critical insights about neoliberal society but also alternatives to its most pervasive effects.

The central questions and themes of the course include: How did ideas of nationhood and national belonging emerge within and across regions? What was the relation between empire and nation? Did nationalist movements alter the meaning and significance of collective identities based on religion, gender, or class? How were concepts of nation, territory, and economy placed together in different nationalist movements? Does contemporary globalization signal the fading of nationalisms and nation-states? Secondary readings (historical and anthropological works) will be read alongside primary materials (novels, pamphlets, and archival documents) to address the historical and conceptual issues raised by nationalism as a global phenomenon.

How much diversity is there and how deep does it go? What makes an outlook and judgment moral?

To what extent is that discourse ethnocentric—a kind of moral imperialism? Are there non-Western (e.g. East Asian) cultures, which offer a challenge and alternative to talk of human rights? Do different moralities correlate with cultural differences? Are we witnessing a ‘clash of civilizations’? How should we respond to the claims of cultural relativism?

We will read some classical texts—such as Michel de Montaigne’s Essays on custom and on cannibalism and Ruth Benedict on patterns of culture, and also contemporary work by sociologists, moral philosophers and others that discusses multiculturalism, moral and cultural relativism and the theory and practice of human rights.

    <p style="font-size: 12px">The word "crowd" today tends to suggest attendees of a sports or music event, and so if you google "crowd control" you will initially find security firms offering "stanchions, barriers and accessories" to help you manage your event--as though contemporary populations have been domesticated to the level of cattle. Though the Arab Spring, the Indignados movement and Occupy Wall Street have reminded everyone that crowds of a different sort are still capable of engaging in collective action, it is possible that contemporary mass demonstrations do not behave much like any of the various types of crowds of the past. Cities may have been designed and have certainly been policed to prevent spontaneous crowd formation; social media have changed the way crowds are organized and articulate themselves; and other media may have contributed to shifts in attitudes towards crowds. Yet at the same time, increasingly dysfunctional "normal" politics in the West, along with rising levels of displaced, dispossessed and persecuted people everywhere, are calling forth a resurgence of crowd activity, from the camp to the public square. 

This course offers a survey of the classic literature on crowds, (Le Bon, Freud, Cannetti, Rudé) as well as more recent contributions (Hardt and Negri's Multitudes) in order to open a discussion about what has happened in the past and what is happening today in direct collective action.

We will explore politics of cultural representation over the last two centuries and how they lend themselves to problematic interpretations of the East/West in general, and the Middle East in particular. Sources to be examined include historical pamphlets, old newspapers, film, travel accounts, and fictional works by authors such as Hanif Kureishi, Tayeb Salih, or Orhan Pamuk.

Students will read secondary sources but we will pay particular attention to memoirs, diaries, and letters. Students will learn about the prescriptive roles of Jewish women in the home, family, religion, and worlds of work and social life. They will focus, however, on the actual activities of Jewish women, what they did, rather than what they were supposed to do. They will investigate the rich variety of responsibilities and tasks that women performed in the (often intersecting) private and public spheres of life, how they both preserved religion in the modern era and also mediated non-Jewish culture for their families. They will further note that women both kept the Jewish family and community together and reached out to non-Jews, joining in secular women’s organizations, local community projects, and the field of social work and teaching. They will discover that women’s roles were often contested and always crucial to the Jewish community.

    <p style="font-size: 12px">Anthropologists have appeared as protagonists and key characters in many horror films. Films like The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988), Ganja and Hess (1973), Candyman (1992) and Cannibal Holocaust (1980), have pitted the anthropologist against powerful spirits and demons, accursed artifacts, mutant beasts, malevolent sorcerers and ferocious cannibals. This course is a critical examination of the anthropologist and anthropological research as conventions of the horror film. Through weekly screenings, reading and discussions, we will examine filmic representations of the anthropologist as a liminal figure – a hapless intermediary between science and superstition, between modernity and arcane tradition – who grapples methodologically with both rationalist and non-rationalist epistemes. We will also examine cinematic depictions of fieldwork as a terrifying, ill-advised crossing of social, cultural, geographic, and temporal boundaries.

These films will be used as a basis to consider the major disciplinary problems, anxieties and even phobias arising out of anthropology’s troubled place in the history of the West. We will look at the often complimentary roles played by anthropological science and the horror genre in constructing, popularizing and sometimes challenging Western notions of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality and citizenship.

This course examines the normative and political dilemmas around issues of citizenship, belonging, and national identity amongst U.S. Latinos- brought about by immigration, transnationalism, neoliberalism, and globalization. These dilemmas revolve around themes national identity and sovereignty, democratic citizenship, and the rights of immigrants. The class will draw from a wide array of readings in political and legal theory, sociology, anthropology, and U.S. Latino studies. By the end of the class, students will be able to articulate and understand political theories of nation-state citizenship, including its historical, sociological, and legal underpinnings. Importantly, students will have a deep understanding of how citizenship is transformed as both a legal status and a set of practices that constitute contemporary political and social membership.

This course explores different manifestations of the machine theme, broadly clustered around the following categories: imaginary machines constituting the centerpiece of narrative plots; machine aesthetic as modernist ideal; and mechanization of the inventive process (text-generating machines). Students read and discuss a selection of works from different cultural contexts, primarily from the late 19th and 20th century (e.g., Belle Époque, Futurist, and postwar), representing a wide spectrum of attitudes toward the machine, from dreamy immersion in virtual realities to enlightened machine-assisted awakening, from the fear of dehumanization to the desire for man-machine fusion.

    <p style="font-size: 12px">In Latin America, the year 1968 marked a turning point in the social, political, and cultural transformations that had had been unfolding in the wake of the Cuban Revolution of 1959. For Latin America, as for the rest of the world, the sixties were shaped by the geopolitics of the Cold War and of anti-colonial struggles across the globe. Yet they are most remembered by those who lived them as a time when ordinary people felt, like never before and perhaps never after, that they could change the course of history. Millions of youth in student movements, advocates for indigenous rights, workers, campesinos, educators, intellectuals, and artists, along with guerrillas and other armed insurgents, were self-aware actors in world-historical projects of radical social, political, economic, and cultural change. In these years, the personal became political, politics became theatrical, theatre became a weapon, and the lines between self, art, and politics were forever changed. In this course we study the complex relations between revolution, counterculture, and authoritarian rule as they emerged in Latin America’s 1968: the emergence of Brazil’s Cinema Novo, Cuba’s imperfect cinema, and militant documentary across the region; the rise of rock and activist nueva canción; and the apogee of student activism and the counterculture in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. We encounter 1968 through art, music, film, fiction, journalism and news coverage, along with other primary documents from the period. No knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese is needed for this course; students with these languages may read texts in the original.

In this course we will explore how artists, activists, governments, and corporations are using social media to reshape Latina/o identity from above and from below. While engaging with various social networking sites (including Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram), we will also consider a range of related phenomena: internet memes, data-mining and hacking, new-media activism around issues such as immigration and gentrification, the politics of hashtagging, social movements in the age of digital libertarianism, and the intersections between technology and race/gender/sexuality/class. Assignments may include a visual essay, a group blog, a mapping exercise, and a social-media project. (No background in media and digital studies is assumed or required.)

Finally, we will look at the decline of knighthood as feudalism gives way to a moneyed, commercial society. Looking toward our modern times, we will ask the inevitable question: is chivalry dead? Readings from the Iberian Peninsula such as El Cantar de mio Cid, Ramon Llull’s Book of the Order of Chivalry, Joanot Martorell’s Tirant lo Blanch, and Cervantes’s Don Quixote will be considered alongside works by the likes of Geoffroi de Charny, Christine de Pizan, Torquato Tasso, and more contemporary authors including Mark Twain and Michael Chabon. The course also will include a visit to the Arms and Armor Department of The Met.

Our reading will help us formulate the political and cultural parameters of 20th century espionage — Banville and Graham Greene both fictionalize the infamous Cambridge spy ring and the life of Kim Philby of the 1930s, and many writers were also spies. But we will also use these texts as a way of examining the relationship between literature and privacy, and the art of fiction and the act of spying. After all, aren’t we listening in to private lives when we read?

Major themes include migration, cross-cultural contact, foreign policy, community and identity formation, capitalism, “free” and “unfree” labor, imperialism, nativism, immigration law and policy, and racism in popular culture.

Their writing offers a nuanced, balanced portrait of contemporary African life, giving a detailed understanding of issues and events and succeeding where their counterparts in mainstream journalism are not.

This seminar explores the nature of suffering and comfort in a context where scientific advances have created heretofore unimaginable possibilities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us. How do people cope with the complexities that illness, the need for care and loss bring into our lives? Readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry and religious texts, guide our discussions about the different ways individuals and cultures treat these important aspects of the human experience. A goal of the course is to familiarize students with the importance of narrative expression in understanding the dimensions of the human experiences of illness, loss, coping and resilience, and the conceptual frameworks that physicians, nurses, social workers, and clergy use as they assist patients and families.

Students will study the consequences of emigration for Ireland and for the receiving nations, as well as Ireland’s transformation in the late twentieth century from emigrant nursery to an emigrant destination. Starting with a chronological focus, the class then moves to a more geographic concentration on some of the most prominent Irish diasporic communities. Besides drawing on the literature extant in the field, we will make use of oral histories, film, and audio sources to explore the relevant themes and topics.

Both lecture and seminar-of-the whole formats will be utilized.
At the end of the course the students should be able to: understand the basic concepts of epidemiologic research design; critically evaluate published epidemiology research article using the Literature Analysis Form-for Epidemiologic Research (LAF-fER); contribute to their future communities as an informed member; and savor and reflect upon the description of epidemiologic outbreaks in literature, esp. in short story and ‘novel-like’ formats.

This seminar engages a conversation between the fields of theatre/performance studies and environmental/animal studies. We will ask how theater has reflected, affirmed, contested, or flagrantly ignored the growing cultural awareness of threats to the environment and of the desperate plight of other species. We will ask how “animal acts”—in plays and elsewhere—work to create meaning about human beings; and how the “staging” of animals—in zoos, circuses, theme parks—illuminates our stagings and dramatizations of the human. We will ask how symbolic “natural” spaces like wilderness, forests, and gardens have shaped our ideas about “cultural” settings like cities, suburbs, and theatres. And we will ask how performance can intervene emotionally and politically on behalf of the non-human world that is so deeply threatened today.

We begin by exploring language as a ‘technology’ of conquest, colonization and evangelization, as well as one of the many criteria used to mark difference in Latin America. Our readings and discussions will concentrate on indigenous, African, and multi-ethnic actors who employed a wide range of linguistic practices – alphabetic, pictorial, tactile, and oral – as they moved between and bridged distinct linguistic ‘worlds,’ frequently in ways that were unsettling for colonial officials. Next, we examine how language ideologies shaped projects of nation building, notions of identity, citizenship and belonging, and conceptions of race in fledgling Latin American nations. Key themes include education, print media and technologies of mass communication, indigenous and social movements, and linguistic and human rights. Finally, we explore how global circulations and transnational power relations impact the linguistic practices, choices and possibilities of Latin American communities at home and beyond.

Or did Eastern Europeans use imperial institutions to their own advantage and form attachments to these empires that would persist after the empires themselves disappeared? We will trace how nationalism became such a prominent and enduring feature of East European politics, while also paying close attention to the many groups and individuals who found exclusive nationalism unappealing and threatening. The course will encourage students to consider the multiple reasons for which parts of Eastern Europe became the sites of some of the world’s most horrific violence. Did the diverse patchwork of religions and nationalities contribute to extreme cycles of violence? How did the designs of external powers for Eastern Europe affect the region during and after World War II?  We will consider how people who left Eastern Europe remembered the region and what they thought of their new homelands. Students will be exposed to different East European perspectives of communism and the Cold War. Moving beyond the reluctance of scholars to treat the period after 1989 as a subject of historical inquiry, the course will analyze Eastern Europe’s turbulent transition from communism to liberal capitalism and conclude with an assessment of the region’s positon in ongoing global developments.

In this course, we will explore the long history of the back-and-forth relationship between the humans and the environment, and examine how past human activity has shaped the world around us. We will review the interactions of climate and environment with the evolution of our species, and explore the effects of the ice ages on human societies and cultures, and on our dispersal across the globe as the ultimate invasive species. We will discover the effects of climate change on societies as diverse as the ancient Middle East, the pre-Columbian Maya, and the Norse settlers of Iceland and Greenland. We will also see how past peoples did not simply react to environmental change, but often induced it, from the earliest domestication of animals and plants, to the manipulation of entire landscapes by Europeans, Native Americans, and Aboriginal Australians. We will examine cases where past societies collapsed due to climatic change, and other examples of societies which continued to thrive despite it, and we will take an anthropological approach to explore how past societies understood environmental change, and its political, social, cultural, and economic ramifications.

We will address this question by examining the extraordinary achievements of Irish writers in the last decade of the 19th century and the first third of the 20th century. In this period Ireland produced writers of international importance and prominence, and also achieved a successful anti-colonial revolution that was to influence revolutionary struggles across the world. How were these linked? How did Ireland’s colonial past, and its participation in the British Empire, influence its literary and cultural traditions?  

We will balance our readings of literature with consideration of the social and historical contexts of Ireland under the Union with Britain, during the First World War and the Irish Revolution, as well as the Irish Civil War, the partition of the country, and the establishment of the Free State and the Republic. In attempting to refine the proper lens through which to view this literature, we will address conceptual issues, including cultural nationalism; the social cataclysm of civil war, and the many attendant post-war and post-colonial obstacles to national reconciliation; the clash between revolutionary anti-imperialism and conservative Catholicism, between rural and urban identities, and between provincialism and cosmopolitanism as strategies for literary self-fashioning.  

Authors on the course include Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, William Butler Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, Lady Augusta Gregory, John Synge, Sean O’Casey, Ernie O’Malley, Elizabeth Bowen, Flann O’Brien and others. Because we are in the middle of the centennial commemoration of evolutionary events discussed on the course, there are significant opportunities to engage with the vibrant fields of digital and public history in Ireland and in New York, via projects in literary cartography, or the digital curation of texts and archives.

Students will write a research paper expanding on one of the areas covered on the syllabus, perhaps a single filmmaker's work, or a corpus of representations reflecting an era of this cinema or a particular knot of concern, such as precarity or sexuality. No knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese is required.

How did the figures we are examining justify their dissent from religion and do their arguments succeed or fail? How did others react to their challenge? Was their dissent met with tolerance or intolerance? In addition to viewing each figure’s dissent in its own social historical context, we will make broader cross-cultural comparisons. At the same time, we will examine our own critical assumptions. Do these diverse figures belong to a single, historically useful category of ‘religious skeptic’? Alternatively, are we viewing them through an anachronistic post-Enlightenment lens? Figures we will consider include: the ‘Pre-Socratic’ philosophers, Socrates as portrayed by Plato and Aristophanes, the authors of the Hippocratic corpus, Epicurus, Lucretius, Ibn al-Rāwandī, Abū Bakr al-Rāzī, and Abū l-‘Alā’ al-Ma‘arrī.

    <p style="font-size: 12px">In the past decade the countries of Europe, and the European Union as an organization, have been facing multiple challenges. The 2008 financial crisis hit several countries and generated a crisis in the shared Eurozone; Euroscepticism has given rise to populist movements throughout the continent; waves of migration were met with struggle and backlash; Western European countries have been threatened by terror; Russia is increasingly aggressive; and recently the US is increasingly indifferent and even hostile toward its European allies. In this course we will attempt to evaluate the following questions: Do these challenges amount to a crisis? Is the integrity of the EU in danger? What can be done to face these multiple challenges? The course explores the dimensions of the European crisis: sovereignty, democracy, economy, security, and culture. We will explore these questions in the EU, in its relationships, and in key individual cases such as Britain, Germany, Greece, Poland, and Hungary.

About Big History, Lowell Gustafston, president of the International Big History Association (IBHA), says, “One of the great human achievements has been the development of an evidence based account of the entire known past that has moved through stages from the Big Bang until today.” The instructor’s recent book, Quarks to Culture: How We Came to Be, develops a new big history of stages as a series of fundamental levels from physics and chemistry to biological evolution, and also to the exciting new field of cultural evolution. In this course, students will have an opportunity to work with the instructor and conduct original research that seeks to apply metapatterns to Big History and the fundamental levels developed in Quarks to Culture. Specifically, metapatterns include binaries, borders, layers, alphabet-like systems, arrows in time, and breaks and cycles in time. Students will develop findings, based on these works and their individual interests and major. Topics can include  the nature of physical laws, patterns of life from physical trees to evolutionary trees, animal societies, language, music, symbols, architecture, mental phenomena (i.e., the time-patterns of thoughts), politics, philosophy, and a wide spectrum of environmental issues. For a sense of the material, see the instructor’s book Metapatterns Across Space, Time, and Mind; the instructor’s papers about metapatterns available from this website (http://metapatterns.wikidot.com/members:tylervolk; for example, Volk and Bloom (2007)); the instructor’s trio of YouTube videos on metapatterns (search “professortylevolk” and “metapatterns”); the review of Q2C by a board member of the IBHA in Science (http://blogs.sciencemag.org/books/2018/01/16/quarks-to-culture/); and web material about the IBHA.

issues of originality in Roman art and of dialogue with authoritative Greek
artistic models. We shall also explore the secrets of the Roman Empire's
longevity.

How should the design of cities respond to the climate crisis? More abstractly, what does a just city look like? As well as lectures and class-room discussions, this is a hands-on course that introduces you to the practices of urban design in a particular way: you'll explore a site in London, the Olympic Park, which is now in the midst of post-Games development. You'll learn photographic and video techniques to analyze the site, and the elements of on-screen design so that you can make proposals about how to develop it. You need no prior background in design or social science to do the course; it is planned so that you can develop skills step-by-step in the field, as well as ideas in the classroom. The aim is to make you more sophisticated in understanding how cities are created. Be warned, though, that you will also be involved in an experiment. Professor Sennett is developing elements of this course in an online format, so that urban design can be studied more generally. You will try out some representational and design techniques, and help him evaluate which works best.
